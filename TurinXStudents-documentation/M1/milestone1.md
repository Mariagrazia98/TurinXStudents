# Milestone 1: Project description and Needfinding: [TurinXStudents]

## Overview and planning

### Main activity
In our original project idea we wanted to help national off-site university students to acclimatize in their new city Turin. The main activity we decided to observe is the process of finding an house to live in Turin.
### Types of people
We choose to observe national off-site university students and help them to serach a place to live in Turin. We can distinguish different type of people:

- First-time off-site students
- Experienced off-site students
- Non-working students
- Working students
- Students that search a house remotely 
- Students that search a house physically

We decided to interview the following students because we believe that they are the most relevant categories for our project, since the process of searching a place to live is heavily influenced by their previous experience: 

- A first-time off-site and non-working student that search house remotely, without knowing anything about the city.
- Two experienced off-site and non-working students that search house physically and had already been in Turin. 
    

## Observation

We decided to asks to students to reconstruct all the steps done when they were searching a place to live.

### First observation (Alessandra):
(This observation regards a master student, in Turin for the first time. She has already got an apartment recently, so she described to us the process to find it) 

We observed that she asked some friends that had already been in Turin in which zone search an apartment confortable for her needs. A friend suggest her some areas and to search on Facebook groups because they don’t involve estate agents. She started searching there and she found this research very difficult because there were no specific filters and required a lot of time (you have to read post by post). Announces were not structured and nor with a clear description, straight to the point and some of them lacked photos. 
Then, she started searching on the following web sites: Immobiliare, Idealista, Subito. She found this research easier than the previous one because she could filter based upon her needs and area even if addresses sometimes were not very precise. At this point, she started to compare the solutions founded using Notion and then sent email or sms to the owners of the most valuable apartments, but she didn't receive answers to any email or message or took a long time. So she started to call directly the owners. She didn’t visit any houses physically, but asked other pictures or videos to the owners. 
At the end, she found the house on Subito. 
She realized that in the areas near university, if you don’t search for a house soon, then it is difficult to find one.

Description: The image shows Notion, a software that helped her to compare in an easy way different houses and to remember appointments.
Comment: This observation highlights how it is difficult to find an apartment for a person that has never rent a house and been in Turin.

### Second observation (Giacomo):
(This observation regards a non-working, master student, that have already rent an house in Turin)

At the beginning he asked his colleagues in which area they live and if they were at ease. This because even if he had already rented an house the previous years, he didn't like the area where he lived. After some suggestions, he started searching houses (to rent as soon as possible) on Facebook groups where there were few advertisements in the recommended areas and the majority without any photos and were too expensive because of late period (he claims).
At the same time, he called some estate agents and searched on different websites (cercoAlloggio.it, subito.it, bakeca.it idealista.it) filtering on area, number of rooms and availability of public transports. For each interested apartment, he took notes on a piece of paper. He didn't find a good solution that could satisfy him. At the end, the observation unfolded in finding his house thanks to a friend.

Description: This screenshot shows ads from one of the existing Facebook groups. It is an example of how the ads are not very detailed and structured for a quick and efficient search.
Comment: This observation shows how it is difficult to find an apartments if you are not organized in keeping in mind viewed solutions. It also shows how it is important to have someone that gives advice.

### Third observation (Giovanni):
(This observation regards a bachelor student, that have already rent an house in Turin)

We observed that he started his search by looking at Telegram groups, where he wrote his application, but he didn't get any responses in a reasonable time and there was too demand compare to available houses.
Then, he looked on websites like MioAffitto.it, Casa.it and Immobiliare.it but he didn't find any apartment in the area he wanted to live.
The observation unfolded in contacting an estate agents that found him an apartment that met his needs to stay alone.

Description: This photo shows a screenshot of the only telegram group available for searching and offering apartments in Turin. It is is an example of how the announcements are mainly made of requests and not offers. To sum up, the search is made slow due to the great number of the former.
Comment: This observation underlines how the lack of direct contacts force him to contact estate agents.

## User Needs

1. Several times rental apartment advs are not exhaustive or structured, they lack important information and pictures that are one of the most important factors for a student in order to consider that adv. So students need more detailed rental apartment offers.

2. Students find hard to get in contact directly with owners. They need a way to find owner contacts that are active and ready to reply in a reasonable time.

3. Students need to have some guidelines about the area that suits best them in order to avoid excessive time wasting.

4. Students need to find apartments provided with desired home appliances.

5. Students need to find cheap solutions, without the intermediation of estate agencies that cost them lots of money. 

6. Students need to remember the features of the different apartments liked.


## Project Description

In our project we decided to address user needs 3 and 6, in order to reduce and optimize the average time spent by students in searching for an apartment. We would like to develop a web application for smartphones whose aim is to be a guide. Firstly, our application, based on the preferences of the student, aim to show the best areas to live for him and refer past experiences of other students that have lived there. Then propose different apartments located in those specific areas, giving the possibility to compare and keep in mind solutions liked.
