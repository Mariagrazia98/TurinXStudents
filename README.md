### Desription

The purpose of this project was to follow an idea and develop it from the early stages, after the process of seeking the need. Prototyping, evaluation, actual development and use testing followed.

In our original design idea we wanted to help off-site national university students acclimatize in their new city Turin. The main activity that we have decided to observe is the process of finding a home to live in Turin. First, the user is invited to fill out a survey the first time they use the application, providing useful information about their preferences and where they are attending or following classes. Then the app will display an ordered list of potential areas, based on the data captured in the previous steps. At this point, the user has the opportunity to see structured ads relating to the selected area, published by the Turin owners and possibly contact them. Finally, the user can save any apartments to examine them later and choose your favorite ones ..
